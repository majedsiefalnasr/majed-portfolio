# Specification Quality Checklist: Content Engine (Blog & Case Studies)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: January 13, 2026  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase.

### Validation Summary

**Strengths:**

- Clear prioritization of user stories with independent testability
- Comprehensive functional requirements covering all aspects (content structure, rendering, components, navigation, media, i18n, performance)
- Well-defined edge cases addressing common failure scenarios
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Proper separation between blog posts and case studies
- Strong internationalization considerations

**Quality Indicators:**

- 30 functional requirements, all testable
- 8 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- 6 user stories properly prioritized (P1-P3)
- 7 edge cases identified
- No technical implementation details present
- All user stories have clear acceptance scenarios

The specification successfully focuses on WHAT and WHY without prescribing HOW, making it suitable for planning and implementation phases.
